# 🚀 Production Readiness Checklist

## ✅ Overall Assessment: **PRODUCTION READY** with minor configurations needed

Your ApnaGhar Plots application is **production-ready** and can be deployed immediately. Below are the items to verify before going live.

---

## ✅ Security (READY - Action Required Before Deploy)

### Must Do Before Deployment:

- [ ] **Change JWT_SECRET** in production `.env`
  - Current: Needs to be set in hosting platform
  - Action: Generate strong random secret (use: `openssl rand -hex 32`)
  
- [ ] **Change Admin Password** after first deployment
  - Default: `admin@example.com / password123`
  - Action: Login to admin panel → Change password OR update in database

- [ ] **Update CORS Origins** in `backend/server.js`
  - Current: Configured to use `FRONTEND_URL` env variable ✅
  - Action: Set correct frontend URL in hosting platform

- [ ] **Enable HTTPS**
  - Vercel/Render: Automatic ✅
  - Custom domain: Configure SSL certificate

### Already Implemented ✅:

- ✅ **Password Hashing**: bcrypt implemented in User model
- ✅ **JWT Authentication**: Protected routes with JWT middleware
- ✅ **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin vs User roles
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Sequelize validation + manual checks
- ✅ **SQL Injection Prevention**: Sequelize ORM (parameterized queries)
