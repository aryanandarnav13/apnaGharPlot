# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Black/Corrupted Images - 5 Minutes

## 🔴 Why Your Images Turned Black

**Render's free tier deletes ALL files on restart** (every 15 mins of inactivity).

Your images were stored in `/uploads` folder → **Backend restarted → Images GONE** 💥

### Step 2: Add to Render (2 mins)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Open your backend service: **apnagharplot-backend**

4. Add these 3 variables:
   ```
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = (paste cloud name)
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = (paste API key)

## ✅ Test It's Working

1. Go to admin panel: https://apna-ghar-plot.vercel.app/admin/plots
2. Upload a new image for any plot
3. Check the image URL:
   - ❌ **Before**: `https://...onrender.com/uploads/...` (deleted on restart)
   - ✅ **After**: `https://res.cloudinary.com/...` (permanent)

## 📸 What About Old Images?

**Bad news**: Old images are already LOST (Render deleted them).

**Good news**: 
- Re-upload all your images (they'll be stored permanently now)
- **Never lose images again!**
- Cloudinary free tier = 25 GB storage

## 🎯 What Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Images stored on Render disk | Images stored on Cloudinary cloud |
| Deleted every restart | **Permanent storage** |
| `/uploads/img-123.jpg` | `https://res.cloudinary.com/...` |
| ❌ Unreliable | ✅ Professional |
